## Introduction: 
This project builds data reports and dashboards for visual representation and storytelling using Microsoft Power BI. The datasets document a variety of airline information including 18 USA airlines, airline code with flight number delay(1 or 0), time, takeofff location, and destinations. The goal of the dashboards is to visualize which airlines have the most delays and potential causes. This information could potentially be useful in the improvement and optimization of airlines, which could improve their branding, customer experience and satisfaction.

Which Airline has the worst delay?

![airline by delay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101579219/178689017-763d4029-c57b-4c3c-afe8-b0d1585943d2.jpg)

This visualization shows a comparison of airlines with delays, given in thousands of flight occassion. This shows that Southwest Airlines (WN) had the highest Delay and was 3,576.20% higher than HA, which had the lowest Delay at 1786 in the overall considered flight occasions.

How does the take off time affects the airline delay?

Now, we can see something interesting and insightful. While this report shows that Southwest (WN) still has the worst delay,we can see that these issues are proportional to the take off time section in each departure location, this is relatively true for all airlines as well.

DashBoard

Finally, this Dash-Board is added to show relationships between each research question and the similiarities between their results.

Recommendation:
---
I would advise people not to fly Southwest Airline (WN) on tuesdays and Wednesdays in the afternoon if they have an important trip to book with a tight schedule. These are cursory observations though, this dataset may not represent previous trends or future possibilities.
